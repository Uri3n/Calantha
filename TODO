This isn't a super comprehensive or detailed list of
things that need to be done, but it should serve as a good general overview
of what needs to be done next!

This project is still in its infancy, so there is a LOT to do:

1. Implement a virtual memory manager

3. Get interrupts working. We need to set up an Interrupt Descriptor Table (IDT) so that
   we can start receiving interrupts from the CPU.

4. Improve the KCore library. A lot. There are a lot of basic data types missing. We need
   strings, string_views, dynamic arrays, and a simple memory allocator. The allocator can 
   be simple for now, we can probably just have a static buffer in the kernel somewhere that the
   allocator manages. 

5. Ask for a framebuffer and figure out how to draw to that framebuffer correctly.
   This will allow us to set up a basic terminal/shell later. For rendering text,
   we can place a font file somewhere on partition and get the bootloader to load it for us. From there we could parse it,
   and use it to render characters to the framebuffer.

6. Find a good way to debug the kernel. I think qemu has debugger support, but I'm not entirely sure how to
   set that up.

7. Find some way to unit test the kernel (i have zero fucking clue how we'll do this lol). This is 
   something to be done much later once we work these other issues out.

There's a lot more. A LOT more. but these are some good starting points.
The easiest thing to check off the list right now would be improvements to Kcore. It's just general 
data structures and functionality we need.
